# 30 days Javascript training

Before jumping into React, I completed this excellent set of courses to strengthen my JS skills.
Learned a lot of ES6 tricks and feeling much more comfortable getting into React.
My recommendation to take the most of those courses is to look at the very beginning of the video to understand what needs to be achieve and then try to solve the problem first on your own before looking at the solution.
